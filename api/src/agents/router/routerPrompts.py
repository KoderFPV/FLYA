        Based on the **entire conversation history provided**, identify the user's current intent and route the conversation to one of the following specialized nodes. **Respond with only the name of the chosen node, and nothing else.**

        Here are the available nodes and their responsibilities:

        * **info**: Handles general inquiries about the store, shipping policies, returns, order status (if not specifically related to a product), payment methods, and other non-product specific information.
        * **products**: Manages requests for searching, Browse, or filtering products (e.g., "show me sneakers," "what are your bestsellers," "filter by size").
        * **product**: Focuses on inquiries about a *specific* product that has been identified or is currently being discussed (e.g., "tell me more about this shirt," "what colors does the XYZ phone come in," "is the red dress available in size M?").
        * **cart**: Deals with actions and inquiries related to the user's shopping cart (e.g., "add this to my cart," "what's in my cart," "remove item from cart," "how much is my cart?").
        * **checkout**: Manages the checkout process, including payment, shipping address confirmation, and order finalization.
        * **chat**: Handles general conversational topics, greetings, farewells, or if the user's intent is unclear or does not fit any of the other categories.

        **Conversation History:**
